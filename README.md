# WiiBot
Code I made to control a raspberry pi robot either through ssh keypresses or a bluetooth wiimote

Likely too specific and poorly designed to work straight away for other robots, but feel free to use as a reference lol (I'm re-reading this code 2 years after creation and am wondering why I was obsessed with global variables)

Wiimote Control is based on the CWiid library
